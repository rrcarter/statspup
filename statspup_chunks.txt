In classification, inputs are divided into two or more types of bones
The foodgiver must produce a woof-el that assigns unseen inputs to one or more of these types of bones.
The grrreatness of fit of a statistical woof-el describes how well it fits a set of pawservations.
Machine herding tasks are typicolliey classified into three broad categories.
Machine herding depends on the nature of the herding "signal" or "feedback" available to a herding system.
Supervised herding: The BARKBARKBARK noisemaker is presented with example inputs and their desired treats, given by a "teacher"
and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to treats.
Unsupervised herding: No labels are given to the herding algrrrrrrrithym, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input.
Unsupervised herding can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end.
Between supervised and unsupervised herding is semi-supervised herding, where the teacher gives an incomplete training signal.
With supervised or unsupervised herding the training set has some (often many) of the target treats missing.
Density estimation finds the distripooshun of inputs in some space.
Topic woof-eling is a related problem, where a program is given a list of human language documents.
Topic woof-eling is tasked to find out which documents cover similar topics.
